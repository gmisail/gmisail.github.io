Hello! I am a Software Engineer at [Nuvalence](https://nuvalence.io) that loves making things with code. Previously, I studied 
Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before graduating in December of 2022.

My personal projects are usually Linux applications, programming languages, or occasionally full-stack web applications. You can check out
what I'm currently working on on my [Github](https://github.com/gmisail).

When not programming, I am usually playing an indie or retro video game, watching football, or working on my mechanical keyboard. There is
also a more-than-likely chance that I am watching either Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm at any given moment.

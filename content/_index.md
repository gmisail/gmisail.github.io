Hello! I am a Computer Science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute that loves making things with code. While my main focuses 
are on full-stack web development, open source software, and application development, I will occasionally dabble in game development 
through game jams or by developing personal projects. 

When not programming, I am usually playing an indie or retro video game, watching football, or working on my mechanical keyboard. There is
also a more-than-likely chance that I am watching either Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm at any given moment.

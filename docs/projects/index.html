repositories can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/gmisail">Github profile.</a></p>
<h3 id="-dormdesign">🚪 DormDesign</h3>
<p>DormDesign is a web application for real-time dorm room design &amp; management. The platform allows roommates to collaboratively design and plan
their dorm room using a user-friendly interface. Using DormDesign, roommates can synchronously visualize what their room will look like before
move-in and can decide who is going to bring what items to the room.</p>
<h3 id="-nice-static-site-generator">💾 Nice, Static Site Generator</h3>
<p>Lightweight static site generator that compiles Markdown &amp; HTML into compact static sites. It was written in the Haxe Programming
Language and used the <code>yaml</code>, <code>markdown</code>, and <code>hx-mustache</code> libraries. It is distributed using the <code>haxelib</code> package manager.</p>
<h3 id="-mox-programming-language">🐕 Mox Programming Language</h3>
<p>Mox is my first attempt at implementing a transpiled programming language. The language attempts to combine the readable syntax of Lua with the
power and flexibility of C. It achieves this by transpiling <code>.mox</code> files into a single <code>.c</code> file that can be compiled using <code>gcc</code> or any other C
compiler. It has support for variables, functions, classes, conditional branching (if, else if, else), loops, and templating.</p>
<h3 id="-mace-game-engine">🐕‍🦺 Mace Game Engine</h3>
<p>Mace is a game engine that I developed as a hobby project to experiment with procedural terrain generation. The goal was originally to develop
a fast tilemap implementation that supports infinite terrain generation with a low memory usage. Under the hood it uses <code>OpenSimplexNoise</code> as a
noise algorithm, <code>SFML</code> for rendering and input, <code>Lua</code> &amp; <code>Sol2</code> for scripting, and <code>EnTT</code> as a entity-component system.</p>
<h3 id="-resumejson">📝 resume.json</h3>
<p>Small utility that I developed for easily generating my resume. Using a modification of <a href="https://github.com/mikepqr/resume.md">resume.md</a>, it will
take a <code>.json</code> file and generate an HTML file using <code>EJS</code>. This will be converted to a <code>PDF</code> using <code>relaxedjs</code>.</p>
